# Converting Depth Anything V2 from ONNX to TFLite

This guide outlines the robust, two-phase process for converting the Depth Anything V2 ONNX model to a TensorFlow Lite (`.tflite`) model.

## Prerequisites: Environment Setup

Before you begin, you must install `onnx2tf` and all of its required dependencies. The following commands will set up your Python environment correctly.

-   Run these commands in your terminal:
    ```bash
    $ pip install -U onnx \
    && pip install -U nvidia-pyindex \
    && pip install -U onnx-graphsurgeon \
    && pip install -U onnxsim \
    && pip install -U simple_onnx_processing_tools \
    && pip install -U onnx2tf
    ```
-   You will also need TensorFlow and OpenCV for the quantization script:
    ```bash
    $ pip install -U tensorflow opencv-python numpy
    ```

## Conversion Workflow

The conversion is a two-step process. You will run two Python scripts in order: first `onnx_to_tf.py`, and then `quantize.py`.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Workspace

1.  **ONNX Model:** Place your original `depth_anything_v2_vits.onnx` file in your project directory.
2.  **Representative Dataset:** This is the most critical component for creating an **accurate** INT8 model.
    -   In the `representative_images`, place **100-200 diverse images** into this folder. These images should be a sample of what the model will see in the real world (e.g., indoor scenes, outdoor landscapes, people, objects, etc.). The quality and variety of this dataset directly determine the final model's accuracy.

### Step 2: Run ONNX to TensorFlow Conversion (`onnx_to_tf.py`)


-   **Execute the script from your terminal:**
    ```bash
    $ python onnx_to_tf.py
    ```
### Step 3: Quantize the Model (`quantize.py`)

-   **Execute the script from your terminal:**
    ```bash
    $ python quantize.py
    ```
## Final Output

After completing both steps, you will have the final, deployable model in your project directory:

-   **`depth_anything_v2_uint8.tflite`**
